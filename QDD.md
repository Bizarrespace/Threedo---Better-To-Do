Question driven development

User stories:
Add the "duration* (enterable), and a "date added" and "date completed" (both display, not entered) components.

## Current progress
- Learn about how hooks are working as well

## Create a component to display a single task in list
- Edit button, launches another page where you can edit the task
  - Same questions of going to another page with that task id
  - How would you edit the task to change the text or the due date?
## "Add Task" button on Front Page, entry form on another page
- The button should take to another page, where you could just reuse the adding logic we already have for switching pages
- Once added you have to go back to the main page
## "Show Completed" toggle on front page
- Show completed tasks, incl date completed, if set
- How would you store the tasks that have been completed?
- Once you know how to store you just render the ones that have been completed instead of the tasks that are right now
## Do a bit of styling.
