Question driven development

User stories:
Add the "duration* (enterable), and a "date added" and "date completed" (both display, not entered) components.

## Open Tasks on Front Page
- Show date added
- Create a component to display a single task in list
## "Add Task" button on Front Page, entry form on another page
## "Show Completed" toggle on front page
- Show completed tasks, incl date completed, if set
## If a task is clicked, go to page that shows it.
- on that page add a "Done!" button
- and an "Edit" button (that, on a new page, lets you edit the task)
## Do a bit of styling.
